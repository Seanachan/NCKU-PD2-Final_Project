**Super Mario Game Replica**

Welcome to my Super Mario Bros. replication project! 🍄🕹️

This project was born out of a deep admiration for the iconic Super Mario franchise and a desire to explore and implement
various coding techniques. In this endeavor, I've employed a variety of design patterns such as including the Singleton
and Factory patterns, to structure the game's architecture and codebase.

One of the key challenges in creating this game was optimizing collision detection and object management. To achieve 
this, I delved into the world of data structures and integrated a Quadtree implementation. This advanced data structure 
significantly enhances performance by efficiently organizing and searching for collisions among game objects. It's a substantial improvement over traditional linked lists and greatly enhances the gaming experience.

Some things to point out:
- This was built on IntelliJ, so you may want to make sure to mark the res directory as source root (right click -> 
mark directory as)
- Some things I will look to work on later:
  - A point system (collecting coins, lives, killing enemies, etc)
  - Sound effects
  - The rest of the levels (like res/level1.png)
  - A menu to move between levels
  - Boss fights
  - Bugs like the one when Mario runs off the edge and falls, but the running animation is not replaced by the falling
  animation, which looks like he is running when falling off
  - Possibly some refactoring

As a personal project aimed at enhancing my coding skills, I want to emphasize that I won't be actively maintaining or 
updating this repository for the foreseeable future. I wanted to prove to myself that I could build a game of this 
complexity, all the while keeping my code as scalable and reusable as I could. This project served as a valuable 
exercise in game development, design patterns, and data structures, and I'm proud of what I've achieved. 🎮

Hopefully, I will feel the inspiration again and pick up from where I left.
Feel free to explore the code, test my prototype, and use it as a learning resource (it would be great if you could 
reference me as well!). If you have any questions or need further insights into any of the techniques or design choices 
I've employed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy gaming! 🌟
